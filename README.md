# churn_predict
In this project, your mission will be to indicate to the company which customers will not renew their bank account in the next year, that is, which customers will enter a "churn" state. Its mission is to train an algorithm that identifies such customers and generates a score, indicating the probability of the customer not renewing the contract with the company. In addition, you need to think of an action plan to prevent these customers from not renewing.
